# BEAST_vs_MENACE_v2.0
Beast Vs Menace with proper classes (hopefully)

A tic-tac-toe machine learning project
(Earliser version was https://github.com/MossGoblin/BEST_vs_MENACE)

___For the moment there will be only notes___

* BEAST ("BEst Available STrategy") will be something similar to https://github.com/MossGoblin/tictactoe_beast -- most likely the only difference will be that I'll rewrite it as OOP and some minor changes in the rules themselves (the implementation of the rules -- i.e. line checks --  will likely remain as it is)
* MENACE ("Machine Educable Noughts And Crosses Engine") will use an old idea I found on Numberphile(@youtube)

__// ChangeLog__

__// TODO : NEXT__
* decide on a final GamePlan for Beast - revise the old one
* who starts first - shall there be a preference?
